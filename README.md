# qtile-enhancements
just putting some scripts and stuff here wich I find useful


## qtilewalldog.sh
- This little slugger will check every 10 seconds (adjustable) if your wallpaper has changed. Only works if you use the qtile built in wallpaper feature and set a specific file as wallpaper. That file in the config must match the one in this script. Whenever you overwrite the wallpaperfile qtile will refresh and show you the new wallpaper.
